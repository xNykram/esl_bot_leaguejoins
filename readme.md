### About Application
> The purpose of the bot is to inform the administrators of ESL MP about emerging leaguejoints (request to join the tournament). The application works locally, it collects login data and additional information that will be provided. It is possible to save the account by locally saving the data in **JSON** file.

### Application functions
>  When the user enters the account data and sets the delay (refresh rate), the bot starts the browser and logs into the administration panel, then enters the tournament page and refreshes the page according to the time we have given until new queries appear. When the bot finds a new request to join the tournament, it sends us information in the form of a system notification. The program will automatically turn off and must be restarted after the team is approved for the tournament.
